# yolo-dnn-cpp
This example demonstrates how to perform inference using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 in C++ with OpenCV's API.

It's based on ultralytics YOLOv8 example: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/examples/YOLOv8-CPP-Inference.

This project supports inference of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with onnx model(static model).
# Runtime Environment
Opencv = opencv-4.8.0
